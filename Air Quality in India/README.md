### Introduction:
India grapples with severe air pollution issues, prompting a robust governmental initiative to enhance air quality monitoring. This study presents the inaugural comprehensive analysis of government-generated air quality observations spanning 2015 to 2020. Leveraging data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring (CAAQM) network, the manual National Air Quality Monitoring Program (NAMP), and the US Air-Now network for PM2.5, our research meticulously addresses data inconsistencies and gaps to ensure representativeness.

Particular attention is given to PM10, PM2.5, SO2, NO2, and O3 pollutants, revealing that particulate pollution predominantly dominates the pollution spectrum nationwide. Notably, in northern India (divided at 23.5°N), virtually all monitoring sites surpass the annual average PM10 and PM2.5 residential National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) by 150% and 100%, respectively. Southern India, while showing relatively lower concentrations, exceeds the PM10 standard by 50% and the PM2.5 standard by 40%. Conversely, annual average SO2, NO2, and MDA8 O3 levels generally comply with residential NAAQS standards across the country.

Regional differentials are pronounced, with northern India exhibiting concentrations 10% to 130% higher than southern counterparts, with SO2 being the exception. Despite discernible inter-annual variability, our study does not identify significant trends in these pollutants over the five-year period. In the five cities equipped with Air-Now PM2.5 measurements – Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai, Hyderabad, and Chennai – a commendable alignment is observed with CPCB data. Furthermore, the PM2.5 CPCB CAAQM data aligns favorably with satellite-derived annual surface PM2.5 concentrations, except for the western desert region, where surface measurements exceeded satellite retrievals prior to 2018.

This reanalyzed dataset offers valuable insights for evaluating Indian air quality through satellite data, atmospheric models, and low-cost sensors. Additionally, it establishes a baseline for assessing the efficacy of the National Clean Air Programme and aids in evaluating current and prospective air pollution mitigation policies.

### Content:
The dataset contains air quality data and AQI (Air Quality Index) at hourly and daily level of various stations across multiple cities in India.
