# Airline Passenger Satisfaction

## Background
Covid-19 has destroyed airline operations all around the world, since most international air traffic has been halted. Singapore Airlines, which has no internal flights in its native country, might be among the most impacted. In reality, some airlines have already declared bankruptcy, such as Thai Airways. However, after the storm passes, demand for air travel is likely to spike as people return from their vacations abroad.

What can airlines do now to gain a competitive advantage when the crowds eventually arrive?

To solve this business challenge, Kaggle's flight satisfaction survey data is used to construct a classification model that identifies the important elements that contribute to customer satisfaction.
